# WebDevProject

hey guys!
i've provided with my complete code, images and pins for my Web Technology Lab Projected named 'GeoMUJ'.

in this project, one can find all the locations of Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ), from the academic blocks to all the chilling points in and around the hostel and campus premises.

in the code, one can find an index.html file with all the basic sentions for the my page, a style.css file for the styling, an index.js javascript file for all the functions to buttons to work, a location.js file consisting of all the co-ordinates points of the locations, lastly there is an auto-comp.js file which contains the code for dropdown menu in the navigation bar, also provided the images and pins used in the project.

for now, that how this website looks: https://ankitaa-maybe.github.io/WebDevProject/
